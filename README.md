# GameCo.

## Introduction
The video game data set has to be analysed and structured in a way that can be easy to analyse, visualise and pull out certain insights to enable the clients to draw conclusions. The provided data set is raw without any processing it can be hard to determine any plausible results.

## Objectives
To gather, clean and visualise the data set to obtain information/insights regarding the sales of video games by GameCo depending on different variables.

## Data set
Source: [VGSales](https://www.vgchartz.com/)
Data set that covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios.

## Missing aspects of the data set

a.  No clarity on the missing values within the data set if it contributes in any way to the understanding of
the information provided by the data set

b.  Without sorting and filtering of the data, it would also not be possible to understand the patterns within
the dataset such as the sales in different years in different regions

c.  In the raw, uncleaned dataset, it would also not be possible to understand the role of different
publishers or the genre with the highest sales values.

## Project Deliverables

a.   Summary stats on a number of variables.

b.   Visualizations

c.   Final Presentation
